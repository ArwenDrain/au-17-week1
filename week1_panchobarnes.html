        <h2>Her Story:</h2>
        <h3>Early Years</h3>
        <p>
            Born Florence Leontine Lowe in 1901, Pancho Barnes was a pioneer not only for women but all of aviation. Pancho decided to learn to fly after driving her cousin to flying lessons. Just after six hours of formal instruction, Pancho soloed her her first flight. Pancho began to make a name for herself by competing in air races, even beating Amelia Earhart's record at the Women's Air Derby in 1930. In 1931 Pancho moved to Hollywood and created a union of film industry stunt fliers called Associated Motion Picture Pilots.

        <h3>The Happy Bottom Riding Club</h3>
        <p>
            By the time the Great Depression hit in 1935 Pancho had lost most of her money, so she sold her apartment and left Hollywood to purchase 180 acres in the Mojave Desert. There Pancho built the Happy Bottom Riding Club, a dude ranch and restuarant that catered to airmen from what is known as Edwards Air Force Base today.
